	<h1>Introduction to Ant</h1>
	
	<p>This is the first time you're viewing Ant, so we just want to let you know a couple of things.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Firstly this is <em>not</em> an installation page. 
				You configure everything yourself; this page just exists 
					to give you some pointers.</li>
		<li>There's a simple test here included to make sure you have the requirements for the database connection to be successful.</li>
		<li>Below is an example of how to create new views, 
				and where to add/edit Less files and JavaScript.</li>
		<li>If you want to know more about Ant and what 
				you can do with it check out

	</ul>
	
	<h2>Database Connection</h2>
	Connection : <span class="{status.class}">{status.database}</span>
	
	<h3>Configuring the Database</h3>
	<p>Import the default Ant database (included in the repo - ant.sql) or create your own. Specify the connection details inside the mysql config file here</p>
	<p><strong><code>{status.config}</code></strong></p>
	
	<h2>Create a new view context</h2>
	<p>You're looking at the Web client. The web client is reserved for desktop browsers. 
		You can serve completely different html depending on the device that's accessing your website.
			But if you don't have more clients configured, Web will be the default.</p>
	
	
	<h3>The PHP</h3>
	
	<p>To create a new view context (a top-level page that can have children):</p>
	
	<p>Create the folder inside the "web" client subdirectory here <br /><strong><code>{newview.folder}</code></strong></p>
	<p>Create the PHP file inside the new folder here <strong><code>{newview.file}</code></strong></p>
	
	<p>Inside your PHP file, you need to declare the route function (namespaced): </p>
	<pre>
namespace Ant\Web\{newview.name};

function index(){
	// This is where you create data for output //
}
	</pre>
	
	<blockquote>I just need a URL to perform an action. What then?</blockquote>
	
	<p>Check out the section below : <a href="setup#controllers">Controllers</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>The HTML</h3>
	
	<p>Create the HTML file to correspond with the view here <br /> <strong><code>{newview.html}</code></strong></p>
	
	<h3>The XML Router</h3>
	
	<p>Whitelist your view in the default route here <strong><code>{newview.route}</code></strong> like so:</p>
	
	<pre>
	&lt;base is="home,user,setup,<strong>newview</strong>"&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<p>The route will look for your newly created php file <strong><code>.\newview\index.php</code></strong> by default, unless you specify otherwise. </p>

	<p>Alternatively, create a route just for this context here <strong><code>{newview.newroute}</code></strong></p>

	<h3>The CSS (Less) and JavaScript</h3>
	
	<p>If you want to add a less file to your project create it here <strong><code>{newview.less}</code></strong></p>
	
	<p>If you want to add a JavaScript file or library to your project create it here <strong><code>{newview.js}</code></strong></p>
	
	<p>Then to make sure it gets included, you need to define it as a resource inside here <strong><code>{newview.resources}</code></strong></p>
	
	<p>Ant will regenerate the less files as css files every time the files are modified. It only performs this locally, so be sure to commit the generated files to your project. </p>
	
	<a name="controllers"></a>
	<h2>Controllers</h2>
	<p>Controllers in Ant are simply namespaced functions that perform actions. You can access a controller directly via a URL. You just need to ensure you define it inside the Route and ensure it falls beneath a context page.</p>
	
	<p>Open the contextual or global route.xml file for the client. <strong><code>{newview.route}</code></strong></p>
	
	<p>Whitelist a controller</p>
	<pre>
&lt;base is="home"&gt;
	
	// User registration and login actions //
	&lt;next is="dostuff"&gt;
		&lt;controller&gt;NewView.doStuff&lt;/controller&gt;
	&lt;/next&gt;

	// More declarations ...//

&lt;/next&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<p>Ant will now attempt to execute that controller when the appropriate URL is used:</p>
	<p><strong><code>/home/dostuff</code></strong></p>
	
	<p>First Ant will look for the context class here <strong><code>{newview.class}</code></strong></p>
	<p> It will attempt to find a function inside the class if the class exists. If it doesn't find the class or function 
			it will search for a controller inside here <strong><code>{newview.controller}</code></strong>
			You can namespace your controllers even further, as you will see inside that folder for better organization.</p>
	
	<p>Note if the top level view "home" does not exist, you will get a 404 error.</p>
	
	<p>What if you don't want an html view for it? Well you can create your own channel, or use the built in "action" channel. </p>
	<p><strong><code>/home/dostuff/?channel=action</code></strong></p>
		
	<p> Using that channel will not attempt to include html, but rather just output the results of your controllers as JSON.
		If you want to redirect to another page after a controller is executed, you can add another controller beneath it inside the Route.xml. 
			Each controller passes its name and associated results to the next controller, and based on those results, you can redirect to a specific page inside
			your custom redirect controller. Like so
	</p>
		<p>Add your own redirect controller</p>
	<pre>
&lt;base is="home"&gt;
	
	// User registration and login actions //
	&lt;next is="dostuff"&gt;
		&lt;controller&gt;NewView.doStuff&lt;/controller&gt;
		&lt;controller&gt;NewView.redirect&lt;/controller&gt;
	&lt;/next&gt;

	// More declarations ...//

&lt;/next&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<h2>Getting stuck?</h2>
	
	<p>Take a look inside the files used to generate this setup page, as well as the files created for unit tests (the "test" client). 
		You should become familiar with how the framework works just by looking through these files. That's the best way to understand the structure.</p>
